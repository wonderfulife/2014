#### Happy New Year    
What's your plan for the New Year? For me the keyword of 2014 is `Management` which will mean
{% highlight perl %}
+ Self-control 	
+ Persevere
+ Accumulation
+ Methodology
+ Efficiency
...
{% endhighlight %}

Let us slow down and take one step at a time. Getting this website running to keep track was my first target. I think I did pretty well.
